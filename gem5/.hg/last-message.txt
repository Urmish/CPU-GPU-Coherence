This patch is used to separate general patches for gem5-gpu and personal patches

It is needed so that when new patches are created at the end of the patch queue
they are inserted well after any general gem5 patches. This greatly eases
merging with changes to gem5-patches.

To add a non-personal patch at the end of the patch queue, pop this patch and
use qnew.

(NOTE: This patch makes no changes to gem5)
