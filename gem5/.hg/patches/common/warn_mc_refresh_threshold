Ruby Memory Controller: Remove refresh deadline

With longer latency memory requests that come with more accurate modeling of
the bus contention, the prior refresh deadlines no longer make sense. Add a
warning when refresh time exceeds 500 cycles, but do not kill simulation.

TODO: If accurate refresh modeling becomes desirable, this should be fixed to
ensure refresh happens promptly.
